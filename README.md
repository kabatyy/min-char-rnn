# min-char-rnn
This repository contains an implementation of a minimal character-level language model with a Vanilla RNN model in Numpy. The model can learn sequences of characters and generate new sequences based on what it has learned. Andrej Karpathy's [RNN tutorial](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/d4dee566867f8291f086) inspires this project and follows a similar implementation approach.
